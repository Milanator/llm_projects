The code snippet you provided seems to have a syntax error, but I can help explain what it seems to be attempting to do based on common Python patterns and structures. The corrected conceptual code would likely look something like this:

python
yield from (book.get('author') for book in books)


### Explanation of the Code

1. **`yield from`**:
   - This is a Python keyword used in generators. A generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values. The `yield` statement produces a value from a generator, and `yield from` is used to yield all values from another iterable (like another generator) as a sequence.
   
2. **`(book.get('author') for book in books)`**:
   - This is a generator expression that iterates over an iterable called `books`.
   - For each `book` in `books`, it calls the `get('author')` method on the `book` object to retrieve the value associated with the key `'author'`.
   - If the `book` is a dictionary or an object that supports `.get()`, this will return the value of the author, or `None` if the key doesn't exist.
   - The generator expression produces a sequence of authors for all books in the `books` collection.

### Why Use This Code?

- **Yielding Values**: The use of `yield from` allows the code to efficiently yield each author sequentially without generating a complete list in memory. This is useful when dealing with large datasets, as it can save memory.
- **Convenience**: If the goal is to create a generator that produces author names one at a time, `yield from` simplifies the process of yielding multiple values from an iterable.
- **Readability**: This pattern makes the intention clearâ€”you're gathering authors from each book and yielding them out, effectively transforming the input collection while keeping the function structure simple.

### Correcting the Syntax

Given your original snippet, if you intended to yield unique authors (assuming uniqueness is desired), you might want to use a set comprehension instead, like this:

python
yield from (author for author in {book.get('author') for book in books})


This would yield unique authors from `books`, but remember that using a set comprehension here will also yield authors only once.

Overall, the intention behind such code often revolves around efficiently processing and generating sequences of data in memory-conservative ways.
